    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      During my studies at the National School of Commerce and Management
      in Oujda I was able to assimilate knowledge in many fields 
      and I was always fascinated by that of Marketing and Sales techniques. 
      I practiced the latter part-time in parallel with my studies and 
      I have always excelled in telesales of energy contracts (electricity and gas) 
      to private and professional prospects in mainland France, so I am currently 
      working my way up to to these kinds of tasks as much as an independant/on land commercial.
